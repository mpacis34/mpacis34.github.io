        My partner and I created an image processing program that supported various image
        manipulation features such as color visualization, component visualization, brightening/darkening,
        horizontal/vertical flipping, blurring/sharpening, and greyscaling while adhering to
        the model-view-controller architecture. The program supports ppm, jpg, png, and bmp files and
        enables the user to load and save images of the following files.
        The program supports interaction via the command line or a GUI built using the Java Spring
        framework that includes image histograms.
