        This website is meant to showcase past projects I have created myself or helped create,
        and it also is meant to provide some information about me. The creation of this website
        represents my first time using HTML/CSS and is an indication of my progress in learning and applying
        tools for front-end development. As a result, this website is subject to future updates aesthetically and content-wise.
