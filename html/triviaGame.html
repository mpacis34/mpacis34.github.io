        Created a 5-level trivia game that is based on a binary tree structure while adhering to the model-view-controller architecture. Each question provided to the user in each level is dependent on whether
        the previous question was answered correctly or incorrectly, with each question provided after a correctly answered question possessing a higher point value than the previous question.
        The program can be run through the command line or either through an interactive GUI built from the Java Swing framework.
