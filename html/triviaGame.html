        Created a 5-level trivia game that is based on a binary tree structure while adhering to the model-view-controller architecture. Each question provided to the user in each level is dependent on whether
        the previous question was answered correctly or incorrectly, with each question provided after a correctly answered question possessing a higher point value than the previous question.
        The program can be run through the command line or either through an interactive GUI built from the Java Swing framework.

        This program was originally an old project with poor design that was made at a time when
        I did not know proper design, so I decided to redesign it to support extensibility and
        with a GUI, which was not present before. The primary improvement of the current rendition of the program
        is the addition of controllers, especially for the version that is run in the command line.
        The command line controller is able to play an arbitrary number of question, while the old code
        hard-coded asking the user a question exactly five times. In regard to potential improvements and
        difficulties, it is laborious to manually create over 100 questions while making sure that the initialization of
        such questions were in the correct order due to each question having left and right children.
        Also, it took me some time to read documentation on how to utilize certain tools of Java Swing, especially with the
        text boxes.
