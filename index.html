    <h1> Hi, I'm Micah Pacis!</h1>
    <br>
    I'm currently a rising sophomore at Northeastern University from Irvine, California. I am majoring in computer science and
    business administration and intend to pursue a concentration in fintech or marketing analytics.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, beating my friends on 200cc in Mario Kart, surfing (not very good at it), watching anime,
    and reading manga.
</p>

    <h1>Things I've Made</h1>
<h3> Trivia Game </h3>
<p>
Created a 5-level trivia game that is based on a binary tree structure while adhering to the model-view-controller architecture. Each question provided to the user in each level is dependent on whether
the previous question was answered correctly or incorrectly, with each question provided after a correctly answered question possessing a higher point value than the previous question.
The program can be run through the command line or either through an interactive GUI built from the Java Swing framework.
</p>
<h3> Image Processor </h3>
<h5>Object-Oriented Design</h5>
<p>
My partner and I created an image processing program that supported various image
manipulation features such as color visualization, component visualization, brightening/darkening,
horizontal/vertical flipping, blurring/sharpening, and greyscaling while adhering to
the model-view-controller architecture
The program supports interaction via the command line or a GUI built using the Java Spring
framework that includes image histograms.
</p>
</p>
<h3> N Bullets</h3>
<h5>Fundamentals of Computer Science 2</h5>
<p>
    My partner and I created a rendition
    of the <a href = https://www.crazygames.com/game/10-bullets-html-5>10 Bullets</a> game
    utilizing Northeastern's FunWorld image library. The game program was created with the use of solely
    immutable data, recursion, and dynamic dispatch.
